# PishCompiler
A compiler written in Java for a made up language called Pish to Mips32

Written for a Compilers class where over the Over the term, in teams of 2 we designed and implemented a compiler.
The compiler was targeted at a subset of the pascal language our instructor called “pish” and generated instructions for Mips32 architecture.
My team used Java as our primary language, JFlex & JCup to parse input code into a grammatical symbol tree and Eclipse and SVN as our development tools.
